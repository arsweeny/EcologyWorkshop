Timestamp,Responder name:,"To what degree would you describe yourself as ""an ecologist"" (including if you identify as ""a ___ ecologist"", e.g. ""disease ecologist"")","Enter the other research (-ologist, -ician, -icist, etc) type labels you might use, separated by commas",Rate your comfort with ecological concepts,Rate your comfort with evolutionary biology concepts,To what degree do you feel you know how your research intersects with ecological concepts?,Please briefly describe how ecological concepts come into play in your research,To what degree do you feel you understand the role of ecological statistics in studying ecological concepts?,Are there any particular areas of ecology and evolution that you find particularly bewildering or alienating?,Is there anything else you would like to convey about your interest in this area? Things you would like us to cover? Anything to help us guide the session to be maximally useful would be really appreciated!

For my dissertation, I approach thinking about infectious disease primarily from an ecological framework. ",5,"I have never been a big adaptive dynamics person, and while I'm good with evolutionary theory and macroevolution, any form of evolutionary work that takes a genomic/genetic bent is not necessarily bewildering, but also very much not something I've done much of. ","I don't really know what the goal of this training session is from like an overall organizational/pedagogical viewpoint, but to me, focusing on where the -omics rubber hits the road with respect to the eco/evo dynamics people on the team are interested in would be worth spending time on!

10/16/2024 11:17:42,Alicia ,4,Bologist ,4,3,5,Life history strategy selection by bats ,3,No,Going over statistics would be useful since we don't have great stats courses at OU. Maybe going through SIR/SEIR/SIRS concepts. How to design ecology-based projects that will actually answer the biological question.
